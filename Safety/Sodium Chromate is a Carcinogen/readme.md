># Safety
>As with other Cr(VI) compounds, sodium chromate is carcinogenic.[6] The compound is also corrosive and exposure may produce severe eye damage or blindness.[7] Human exposure further encompasses impaired fertility, heritable genetic damage and harm to unborn children.

># Toxicity
>Hexavalent chromium compounds can be toxic and carcinogenic (IARC Group 1). Inhaling particles of hexavalent chromium compounds can cause lung cancer. Also positive associations have been observed between exposure to chromium (VI) compounds and cancer of the nose and nasal sinuses.[11] The use of chromate compounds in manufactured goods is restricted in the EU (and by market commonality the rest of the world) by EU Parliament directive on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive (2002/95/EC).
